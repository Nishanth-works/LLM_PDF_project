  - Error Handling: Robust error handling and logging for stable application performance.
  - Modular Design: Cleanly structured code for easy maintenance and scalability.

### File Structure

The application is organized into several modules, each with a specific responsibility:

     - main.py: The main script that runs the application, handles the Streamlit UI, and orchestrates the flow of the application.
     
     - utils/pdf_extractor.py: Handles the extraction of text from PDF files.
     
     - utils/indexer.py: Manages the indexing of extracted text for search and retrieval.
     
     - utils/confidence_measure.py: Mange and maintail logic for Checking for phrases that might indicate uncertainty
     
     - ui_components.py: Contains functions related to the Streamlit user interface components.

     - test_app.py: holds unit test function to validate the components
     
     - .env: (Not in the repository) A file for storing environment variables like the OpenAI API key.```

### Module Responsibilities

    - pdf_extractor.py:
        Extracts text from a given PDF file.
        Returns the extracted text as a string.
    - indexer.py:
        Splits the extracted text into manageable chunks.
        Creates a searchable index using LangChain and FAISS.
    - ui_components.py:
        Houses functions for creating and managing UI components like buttons, text inputs, and displaying responses.
    - main.py:
        Initializes the application.
        Manages the workflow of uploading PDFs, extracting text, indexing, querying, and displaying results.

### Steps to Run and Execute the Code

  #### 1. Clone the Repository:



  ```
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/zania-pdf-chat-app.git
  cd zania-pdf-chat-app
```

#### 2. Set Up a Python Environment:

   It's recommended to use a virtual environment:
   ```
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

#### 3. Install Dependencies:

  Ensure requirements.txt is present and run:

   ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

#### 4. Environment Variables:

   - Create a .env file in the root directory.
   - Add your OpenAI API key:
```
    makefile

    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
  ```  

#### 5. Running the Application:

  Execute the main script with Streamlit:

  ```
  streamlit run main.py
```

  Using the Application:
      The Streamlit interface should open in your browser.
      Upload a PDF file and ask questions to interact with the application.

### Conclusion

Zania PDF Chat App demonstrates the power of LLM techniques with user-friendly interfaces. It serves as a useful tool for extracting and interacting with information from PDF documents, showcasing the potential of AI in information retrieval and processing.
